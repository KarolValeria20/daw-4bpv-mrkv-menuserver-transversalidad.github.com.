<font face="optima" color="green">
<p align="left">I wish you went behind my back <br>
And told me lies and stuff like that <br>
I wish you kissed someone I know <br>
And did the unforgivable <br>
<br>
Maybe hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt </p>

<p align="center">So I'm gonna hate you <br>
I'm gonna hate you <br>
Paint you like the villain that you never were <br>
I'm gonna blame you <br>
For things that you don't do <br>
Hating you's the only way it doesn't hurt </p>

<p align="right">We weren't perfect, but we came close <br>
Until I put all of our pain under the microscope <br>
And I still can't face it <br>
I'm still in love, for what it's worth <br>
<br>
Maybe hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt </p>

<p align="left">So I'm gonna hate you <br>
I'm gonna hate you <br>
Paint you like the villain that you never were <br>
I'm gonna blame you <br>
For things that you don't do <br>
Hating you's the only way it doesn't hurt </p>

<p align="right"> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh <br>
<br>
It's not the truth <br>
It's not the cure <br>
But hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt </p>
