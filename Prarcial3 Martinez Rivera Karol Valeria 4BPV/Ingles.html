    <p class="uno">
        Nuclear energy can be used to produce electricity. But first the energy must be released.
        This energy can be obtained in two ways: nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. In nuclear fusion, the energy
        It is released when the nuclei of atoms combine or fuse with each other to form a larger nucleus.
        This is how the sun produces energy. In nuclear fission, nuclei separate to form smaller nuclei,
        releasing energy. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to produce electricity.

        <img src="img\nuclear4.jpg" class="img"><br>
        When one of these two nuclear reactions occurs (nuclear fission or nuclear fusion) the atoms
        experience a slight loss of mass. This mass that is lost is converted into a large amount of energy
        heat and radiation, as Albert Einstein discovered with his famous equation E=mcÂ². The heat energy
        produced is used to produce steam and generate electricity. Although the production of electrical energy is
        The most common use given to nuclear energy, it can also be applied in many other sectors,
        such as in medical or environmental applications.

    <h1 class="tema2">Nuclear fision</h1>

    <p class="tres">Nuclear fission is the reaction in which the nucleus of a heavy atom, upon capturing an incident neutron,
        It splits into two or more nuclei of lighter atoms, called fission products, emitting neutrons in the process.

        certain geometry conditions of the fissile material are met and a certain threshold of its quantity is exceeded,
        known as critical mass. Fission can occur spontaneously, but the existence of a
        neutron that hits with the appropriate energy.

    <h1 class="tema3">Nuclear fusion</h1>
    <p class="cuatro">
        Nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two nuclei of light atoms, generally hydrogen and its
Isotopes (deuterium and tritium), join together to form another, heavier nucleus, usually releasing particles in the process. Are
Reactions can absorb or release energy, depending on whether the mass of the nuclei is greater or less than that of iron, respectively.

        An example of fusion reactions are those that take place in the sun, in which the fusion of nuclear nuclei occurs.

reaches the earth's surface and which we perceive as light and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a fusion reaction to take place, it is necessary to reach high energy levels that allow the nuclei to approach each other.

        must meet the following requirements:

        <li>To achieve the necessary energy, particle accelerators can be used or heating at very high temperatures can be used. 
            <br> This last solution is called thermal fusion and consists of heating the atoms until achieving a mass

            <li>Likewise, it is necessary to guarantee the confinement and control of the plasma at high temperatures in the cavity

            <li>It is also necessary to achieve sufficient plasma density so that the nuclei are close to each other and can give rise 
                to fusion reactions.</li>

        A nuclear power plant is an industrial facility in which electricity is generated from the thermal energy produced through <br> fission reactions in the vessel of a nuclear reactor. The central component of a power plant is the reactor,
        which is the <br> facility where the nuclear fuel is housed and which has systems that allow the controlled initiation, maintenance and stopping of nuclear fission reactions that release large amounts of thermal energy. The
        Released thermal energy is used to heat water until it becomes steam at high pressure and temperature. This steam rotates a turbine that is connected to a generator that transforms the mechanical energy from the rotation of the turbine.
        in electrical energy, ready for industrial use. <br>
